                 FOR HUMAN ACTIVITY RECOGNITION EXPEREMNTAL DATA  

Human Activity Recognition summarized dataset contains average values of the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living 
(ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

Information about measures used to calculate average values:
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 
Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz were captured. 
The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 

Dataset contains  68  Variables  and  180  Observations.
